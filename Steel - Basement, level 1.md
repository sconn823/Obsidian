*A neatly decorate marble lobby. The polished floor below reflects the flickering buzzing lights above. Your footsteps echo ominously throughout the space. The east, two large imposing steel doors bar the way. To the west, a series of bright red arrows invite your forward*

The lobby is devoid of life.  From the eastern wall, sounds of slight pangs can be heard.

*a series of growing marks on the floor usher you forward. Simple music is arcanely playing through the hall. A figure can be seen walking south towards the lobby. The figure is impossibly thin and tall. Tan leather covers every inch of their body. Even their face is hidden behind some sort of metal mesk with large goggles covering the eyes. Several loose rubber hoses extend from the bottom of the mouth plate, and expand and shrink as a terrible rapsy breathing voice *
