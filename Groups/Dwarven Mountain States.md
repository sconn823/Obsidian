Confederation of like minded fotresses who have agreed to pull their resoruces together in order to better maintain the saftey of all members.

Each fotress has a population of anywhere to dozen to a hundred, to a thousand members. These fotresses mainly exist on the northwest section of the continent of [[Dormhanda]], but smaller enclaves holds all throughout the contient. 

Fortresses are traditionally subterranian with minimal to sometimes no surface infrastructure. This has led to several conflicts over the centuries as human or other settlers attempt to claim and build the land above the fortress. This had led to conflict when farmers from these new surface settlements attempt to mine and find themselves in the bedroom of a dwarven prince. 

Taxes and representation are proportional to population size.
