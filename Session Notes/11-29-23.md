## Ramiel
Ramiel's swordfighting style is a common style taught in Oasis utilizing a long curved saber. It includes a lot of movement and pirouettes targeting vital points like joints or exposed areas in armor with the tip of the blade to weaken a target. Killing blows are made using the wider, heavier part of the blade. Mechanically, this is why Ramiel gets sneak attack when he's dueling an enemy with no allies nearby (the Swashbuckler feature), because he needs a lot of space to perform these frilly movements.
