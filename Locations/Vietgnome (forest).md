The forest of Vietgnome is a vast woodland ecosystem located north of the human kingdom of Rhodania. Extending for hundreds of miles, the forest has a vast diversity in its foilage. Towards the south more Temperate brush and trees can be found, while to the north, harsh and wintered booreal trees stand tall agaisnt the bitter colds. In a similar fashion to its flora diversity, a massive diversity of fauna can be seen through the region, as both beast and monster congregate within.

The  [[Abhainn River]] flows through the center of the forest, carrying fresh cool water from the mountains to the north. The abhain eventually snakes westward, and back through north Rhodania and the mountain states before depositing within the Emerald Channel.
