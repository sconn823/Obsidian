## Setup
The Dureragar have been excavating this site ever since [[Duregar Emperor]] recieved a message from [[Talos]] stating that something of significance was there. After several weeks of drilling, the Dureragar discovered the remains of the [[B.E.A.C.O.N.]] [[Aquanaut]] beneath the surface of the forest. 

Talos and the emperor conspired to make the suit into an avatar of Talos, by placing captured prisoners into the heart of the marchine, and performing the [[Ritual of Convergence]].

## Gameplay
The goal of this dungeon is for the players to deactivate the malfunctioning servos in the lower left foot to gain access to generator room within the dormant giant, and retrieve the [[Arcane Accumulator]] within.

## Areas

### 1
Entry way from the cavern entrance above.
*Columns of rubble and debris intially block your perception from without the cavern. Venturing further in, the stone here has been cruely chipped away, revealing a horrible metal visage carved from rusted bronze. Its eyes are blotted out and blackened. Rotted ivy clings to its hull, like filthy hair to sweaty flesh. Its gaping maw filled with glass teeth and death. You remember this face. The Marked Men wore it when they earned their title in defeating the Dragon Queen. This is a brother of the Natilus; Submerged under the Ancient forest of Vietgnome.*

Within the mouth of the [[Aquanaut]] are the corpese of several Duergar soliders, and dwarven writing on the eastern wall, above the broken monitor.

#### Engraving
In the dwarvish, the engraving reads:
*"Here lies the crew of the Aquanaut, perhaps the last of their kind from our home Ymir. We were doomed by metal before, and we were doomed by the woods here."*

Within the opening here is a series of supply crates. They contain mundane supplies and rations. 




### 2
*You begin traversing the metalic throat of the Aquanaut. Each step echoing horribly around the beaten walls about you. The passage gives way to yet another interior composed all of rusted metals. Rows of rotted leather chairs face smashed monitors across the walls. *

#### Corvos
[[Corvos]] will enter this room as soon as the players enter the cavern. He will hide in a vent, and cast an illusionary version of himself heading to room 4. 

Any players can spot him with a DC 21 Perception check.  

### 3
Pillars room.
*Large metal beams hold the interior of this room together. Each stretches all the way from the bottom of the room to the ten floor ceiling. High piles of rocks and debirs intermingle with the intentionally contrsructed one, obstrucing movement between them*

#### Trap
Moving past any of the debris of pillar have a small change of collasping it on those around. Each time a player walks by an unstable pillar, roll a d20. On a 1, all players within a 10 ft radius must make a DC 12 dex saving throw, or take 2d6 + 2 damage.

### 4
#### 4a
Trap - the whethered remains of a dwarven pilot lays there, a [[Plasma Pistol]] had been used to blow his brains out. 3d4 Cadevar Sprits spring forward from the corpse as the players open the door.
