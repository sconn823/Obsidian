## Setup
The Dureragar have been excavating this site ever since [[Duregar Emperor]] recieved a message from [[Talos]] stating that something of significance was there. After several weeks of drilling, the Dureragar discovered the remains of the [[B.E.A.C.O.N.]] [[Aquanaut]] beneath the surface of the forest. 

Talos and the emperor conspired to make the suit into an avatar of Talos, by placing captured prisoners into the heart of the marchine, and performing the [[Ritual of Convergence]].

## Gameplay
The goal of this dungeon is for the players to deactivate the malfunctioning servos in the lower left foot to gain access to generator room within the dormant giant, and retrieve the [[Arcane Accumulator]] within.

## Areas

### 1
Entry way from the cavern entrance above.
*Columns of rubble and debris intially block your perception from without the cavern. Venturing further in, the stone here has been cruely chipped away, revealing a horrible metal visage carved from rusted bronze. Its eyes are blotted out and blackened. Rotted ivy clings to its hull, like filthy hair to sweaty flesh. Its gaping maw filled with glass teeth and death. You remember this face. The Marked Men wore it when they earned their title in defeating the Dragon Queen. This is a brother of the Natilus; Submerged under the Ancient forest of Vietgnome.*

Within the mouth of the [[Aquanaut]] are the corpese of several Duergar soliders, and dwarven writing on the eastern wall, above the broken monitor.

#### Engraving
In the dwarvish, the engraving reads:
*"Here lies the crew of the Aquanaut, perhaps the last of their kind from our home Ymir. We were doomed by metal before, and we were doomed by the woods here."*

Within the opening here is a series of supply crates. They contain mundane supplies and rations. 




### 2
*You begin traversing the metalic throat of the Aquanaut. Each step echoing horribly around the beaten walls about you. The passage gives way to yet another interior composed all of rusted metals. Rows of rotted leather chairs face smashed monitors across the walls. *

*A monitor on the south wall shows a depiction of a large metal contruct with various graphs and displays showing systems in a critical status. Large dwarven glyphs of exclamation can be seen coming from both of the legs of the machine.*

On a DC 11 investigation check, players can determine that these glyphs indicate soemthing in the lower torso is draining all the power to the door controls.


#### Corvos
[[Corvos]] will enter this room as soon as the players enter the cavern. He will hide in a vent, and cast an illusionary version of himself heading to room 4. 

Any players can spot him with a DC 21 Perception check.  

### 3
Pillars room.
*Large metal beams hold the interior of this room together. Each stretches all the way from the bottom of the room to the ten floor ceiling. High piles of rocks and debirs intermingle with the intentionally contrsructed one, obstrucing movement between them*

#### Trap
Moving past any of the debris of pillar have a small change of collasping it on those around. Each time a player walks by an unstable pillar, roll a d20. On a 1, all players within a 10 ft radius must make a DC 12 dex saving throw, or take 2d6 + 2 damage.

### 4
*A rusted out room. Metal particles flitter around the room. Green lights glow constantly at the east and west doorways, where red lights are present at the two south rooms.*

Each of the south rooms require a DC 13 
#### 4a
Trap - the whethered remains of a dwarven pilot lays there, a [[Plasma Pistol]] had been used to blow his brains out. 3d4 Cadevar Sprits spring forward from the corpse as the players open the door.

In addition, a note written in dwarvish reads the following:

*The B.E.A.C.O.N. energy reserves are falling. Will need to deactivate all unnecesary output until this is resolved. Might make things easier with one less mouth to feed. I go home now to Moradin*

### 5
*Debris litter the room. Upon close inspection, the damage appears to be recent. Crushed limbs pertrude from the mishapen rock piles.*

5 duergar screamers hide in the area here. They wait until one of the party members triggers the trap in room 6 to engage. They can be seen lurking in the dark with a DC 15 perception check

### 6
*A long rusting hallway. A large door bars the other side and appears be firmly in place.*

In this hallway is a  tight squeeze trap. Any PCs walking through the middle of it must make a DC 18 strength check. On a failed save, they take 5d10 bldugeoding damageas the creature is pulled deeper into the wheels and gears below. If the creature is still grappled at the end of each of their turns per intiative, the gears tug them deeper, dealing another 5d10 damage. 

*You take another step forward and the rusting floor below gives way, gripping your foot between two heavy gears. *

### 8
*This appears to be one of the hands of the mighty titan. A skeletal figure wearing faded blue overalls lies dead. On the form's right arm is a metal gauntlet with spikes sticking out of one side.*

This item is a [[Shield Bracelet]].
