## Setup
The Dureragar have been excavating this site ever since [[Duregar Emperor]] recieved a message from [[Talos]] stating that something of significance was there. After several weeks of drilling, the Dureragar discovered the remains of the [[B.E.A.C.O.N.]] [[Aquanaut]] beneath the surface of the forest. 

Talos and the emperor conspired to make the suit into an avatar of Talos, by placing captured prisoners into the heart of the marchine, and performing the [[Ritual of Convergence]].

## Gameplay
The goal of this dungeon is for the players to deactivate the malfunctioning servos in the lower left foot to gain access to generator room within the dormant giant, and retrieve the [[Arcane Accumulator]] within.

### Areas

#### 1
Entry way from the cavern entrance above.
*Columns of rubble and debris intially block your perception from without the cavern. Venturing further in, the stone here has been cruely chipped away, revealing a horrible metal visage carved from rusted bronze. Its eyes are blotted out, and blackened, and its gaping maw opens, inviting you within.*
