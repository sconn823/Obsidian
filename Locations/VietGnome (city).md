VietGnome is a gnomish city located in the forest of the same name.
A massive sequoia tree, propped up by both architectural prowess and druidid magic. This centuries old fotress has long been the home for most gnomes in the continent of Dorhamnda. From their arborial citadel, they watch over the vast forests of [[Vietgnome (forest)]] and the bio diveristy within. 



The city is designed into 6 regions.

The base, sometimes known as "[[The Stump]]", this is the first area travelers will reach when they arrive at the city. Named for the ramshackle community build at the base of the establishment. hear, large stairwalls have been attached to the massive base of the tree, or in some instances carved directly into it. This massive stairwell winds counterclockwise around the trunk of the treek, hundreds of feet up into the air until it reaches [[Branch Junction]]. Along the way up, it also passes by several smaller branch colonies which house communities responsible for maintaining the stairwell upward.

[[Branch Junction]]
The junction is aptyl named as it is where the four major branches of the tower come together. The district is made up of a central palace carved directly into the bark of the tree. Between each of the four major branches is a large flat circular board walk, attached by a massive metal beams which are wrapped around both the trunk, but each of the four large branches jutting off from it. This archetitural marvel was a gift granted to them by the departing dwarven armies as a sign of goodwill following the end of their occupation
