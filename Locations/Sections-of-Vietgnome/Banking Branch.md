Mostly closely associated with the [[Dwarven Mountain States]]

Contains air docks for Dwarven Airships.

First place when party arrives.

## Description
This massive branch of [[VietGnome (city)]] spans roughly one mile long and a quarter as wide. Here, a steady as opposed to most of the structures you can see jutting out from the Arborial fortress, a solid base of concrete has been leveled attop the actual bark of the branch; secured in place via a series of long metal railings.

Atop this platform are rows of neatly organized grey stone houses with bronze trim, in the style of the [[Dwarven Mountain States]]. It is easy to see a small army of gnomes and dwarves running too and fro holding bundles of scrolls. Most are well dressed in dwarven-style business suits, with anxious looks in their eyes.

Long irons scraffoldings jut out from the platform towards the side of the branch most opposite the tree. Already several smaller zepplin style blimps are situated here, having small crews of workers load and unload their goods into a series of warehouses along the edge of the platform by the docks.
