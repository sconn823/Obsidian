Group will have a set number of days (FIGURE OUT THAT NUMBER OF DAYS) until the gnomish independence day celebration. This will be a way to clue us back to the relationship between the dwarves and the gnomes, and why animosity exists between them.

1st Session will start with them get a briefing on a dwarven airship, and landing on the [[Market Branch ]]. On their way to the [[Branch Junction]], they will be stopped by a parade celebrating for their upcoming indepedence day.

This holiday marks the day the [[Dwarven Mountain States]] officially ended its occupation of [[VietGnome (city)]].
