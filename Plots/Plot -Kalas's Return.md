Should [[Kalas]] go down again, he will awake to see [[Juno]] speaking to kalas's father, [[Helios]]

Juno will explain that kalas simply needs time.
Helios warns that if he continues to jerk his resposibilites, Helios will have no alternative but to intervene himself. If the world cannot be saved for the ritcheous, then he shall ensure it cannot fall into the infernal's hands.
