## Political 
The Dominion of Duregar hope to place a massive drill within the city of Vietgnome in order to gain access to the Eastern Intersection and cut off the dwarven city states of [[DÃ´bar]] and [[Obok ]]from the rest of the mountain forces to the West.

They also wish to use the resources of the forest to augment their current industrial level, and to expand their arsenal. 

## True Intetions
They also hope to use the metal in the railwork system, as well as the life force and raw resources above to create an avatar for their god, Talos; God of Machines.

To that end they are experimenting by creating smaller avatars to whom in their [[Research Facility]] in the eastern [[Vietgnome (forest)]].
