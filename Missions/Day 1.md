### Description of the [[Led Balloon]]
Image of a peaceful forest with critters going about their business suddenly interrupted by an imposing form of steel and iron cruising just above the tree line.
900 feet long with armor as dense as a foot and a half on its weakest position. Half a dozen cannons pointed stern and portside loom ominously, pointed downwards, with two more pointed forward-ahead.
The Led Balloon, pride of the dwarven mountain fleet, barrels its way ahead at a leisurley 4 mph.

The gang have had rather crampt living conditions over the past few weeks it has taken you to travel from the heart of the [[Dwarven Mountain States]] main territory towards their destination. The accomadtions you were offered, though technically considered the ambassadorial suite, were suited with dwarven-sized individuals in mind. You have all a lot of time with each other-perhaps too much time.

However, your journey is nearly at an end as [[Rurik Eversharp]] has welcomed you aboard his brigde for a celebratory brandy, and to rebrief you all on the status of what is to come. 

Ask the party how they are feeling.

### Briefing
Tensions have been high with the [[Duregar Dominion]] ever since they began expanding outwards from [[Khonudrakar]] far to the east. Now, they have arrived in [[Vietgnome (forest)]] with ill intent on the wind.

The [[Dwarven Mountain States]] are anxious that the [[Duregar Dominion]] intend to take the city, and then use it to capture [[Dwarven Tunnel Intersection 1]] below, cutting off [[Obar]] and [[Dobar]] from the rest of the states.

The [[Arboral Council]] is currently divided into factions.


### Arrival in [[VietGnome (city)]]
Players enter via airship docking with the [[Banking Branch]]



taken through brief tour of the [[Branch Junction]] and shown around the four other branches as wall as the [[Grand Hall]]



Players will learn via a council meeting the [[Duregarian Dominion]] has advanced beyond the border of the [[Abhainn River]], and have seized control of a region there. Members of the [[Amethyst]] sect will insist that this act is legal, as they have granted the dominion rights to mining operations east of the river, and the specific section they have occupied is still eastern of the western-most part of the stream.

[[Rurik Eversharp]] will ask the party to investigate the dig site, and to discover what the duregar are doing.

Once the council concludes, the players will have until nightfall to gather their gear and depart.
From here the groups are welcome to visit the shops in the [[Roots]], or on the [[Banking Branch]]


### Withdrawl Day parade

### The Council Meeting

The [[Silver]]s represent those loyal to the Dwarves, even after the [[First Battle of Vietgnome]] and subsequent and disastorous [[Second Battle of Vietgnome]].

The [[Amethyst]]s are those who have been bought out by the [[Duregar Dominion]], and wish to invite them into the city.

The [[Green]]s wish to see an indepent [[VietGnome (city)]].

When the group arrives during a heated debate between [[Brad Tomy]] and [[Oakroot]]. The latter arguing that the [[Duregar Dominion]]'s recent occupation at the [[Excavation Site]] represents a breach of their arrangement with [[VietGnome (city)]], while the former argues that their agreement seeded land to the Dominion east of the [[Abhainn River]], but did not specify at which point, as the river flows and curves.

The bickering continues with [[Queen Regent Krixi Berryguard]] demanding to be reminded why they allowed such a blatant disregard of [[VietGnome (city)]]'s independence.

[[Brad Tomy]] begins a conversation about why this occured but is interputted by an empassioned [[Valvalur]], who proceeds into a long winded monolouge about the [[Dwarven Mountain States]]'s imerpialsim and colonization of the region, the tragedies of the [[First Battle of Vietgnome]], and the loss of dozens of innocent pixies and woodland folk during that time. She also hilights the hypocricy of the [[Silver]]s allegiance to the [[Dwarven Mountain States]]. She reminds them that it was a deal brokered by the late [[King Lofiz Berryguard]] but ultimately concludes and reminds them that only by a vote of 4/6 majority can the Dominion be legally vacated from the land. 

[[Boudicca]], who at this time had been widdling at a stick she found, simply reminds everyone that she has not love for either the [[Dwarven Mountain States]] nor the [[Duregar Dominion]], but agreed only to help maintain the balance of power in the region. In addition, she will remind the council that the pressing concern should be looking into the recent dissapearances of folks with the [[Roots]]

On a dc 13 insight check, players may be able to determine that [[Boudicca]] is quite frustrated by the whole affair, and that there is regret in her voice about the decision to invite them.

Following this discussion, the players will be introduced by [[Ambassador Rubin Obar]] as friends to the [[Dwarven Mountain States]], and be invited to ask any questions of the [[Arboral Council]].

After the meeting concludes, [[Ambassador Rubin Obar]] and [[Queen Regent Krixi Berryguard]] will ask the group to head over the [[Excavation Site]] and investigate what the duregar are doing there.

### Down time before heading out
- [[Rurik Eversharp]] asks the group to head over to [[Dwarven University of Metalurgy & Balistics(D.U.M.B)]] to collect an [[Arcane Accumulator]] from head researcher [[Johnny Two-Wands]]
- Group can head over the [[Royal Aparmtnet]] in order to grab cocktails and chat with [[Queen Regent Krixi Berryguard]] and [[Ambassador Rubin Obar]] playing with the young [[Prince Orfan Berryguard]].
- Group can look into disappearances by talking with either [[Boudicca]] in the [[Grove Branch]] or by visiting the [[Rusted Root]] in the [[Roots]]. Boudicaa will indicate that she is frustrated by the disappearnces, but does not wish to spark another conflict.
- 



### Heading out/ navigating [[Vietgnome (forest)]]

Navigating will be done by [[Jan's Character]], as his moment to shine. Three DC 10 survival checks will be required to make it through the forest. He almost take a help action on any of them.
Should the group fail at least one of these checks, everyone will have to make a DC 15 constitution save or gain 1 level of exhaustion.



#### Should the players choose to attempt to cross [[Abhainn River]]

[[Duregarian Dominion]] mercanaries hidden under the river will approach and accost them with ranged attacks.
