Battle in Hell in Helanthius,
The group failing to apprhend True Face
Saving the Councilman Drake Goodwyb

The death of Balthazar, and possibly losing out on where ever he kept his riches...

### Description of the [[Led Balloon]]
Describe cramped interior of halls. 
Taller chara

### Arrival in [[VietGnome (city)]]
Players enter via airship docking with the [[Banking Branch]]

taken through brief tour of the [[Branch Junction]] and shown around the four other branches as wall as the [[Grand Hall]]

Players will learn via a council meeting the [[Duregarian Dominion]] has advanced beyond the border of the [[Abhainn River]], and have seized control of a region there. Members of the [[Amethyst]] sect will insist that this act is legal, as they have granted the dominion rights to mining operations east of the river, and the specific section they have occupied is still eastern of the western-most part of the stream.

[[Rurik Eversharp]] will ask the party to investigate the dig site, and to discover what the duregar are doing.

Once the council concludes, the players will have until nightfall to gather their gear and depart.
From here the groups are welcome to visit the shops in the [[Roots]], or on the [[Banking Branch]]
