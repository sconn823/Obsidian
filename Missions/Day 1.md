### Description of the [[Led Balloon]]
Image of a peaceful forest with critters going about their business suddenly interrupted by an imposing form of steel and iron cruising just above the tree line.
900 feet long with armor as dense as a foot and a half on its weakest position. Half a dozen cannons pointed stern and portside loom ominously, pointed downwards, with two more pointed forward-ahead.
The Led Balloon, pride of the dwarven mountain fleet, barrels its way ahead at a leisurley 4 mph.

The gang have had rather crampt living conditions over the past few weeks it has taken you to travel from the heart of the [[Dwarven Mountain States]] main territory towards their destination. The accomadtions you were offered, though technically considered the ambassadorial suite, were suited with dwarven-sized individuals in mind. You have all a lot of time with each other-perhaps too much time.

However, your journey is nearly at an end as [[Rurik Eversharp]] has welcomed you aboard his brigde for a celebratory brandy, and to rebrief you all on the status of what is to come. 

Ask the party how they are feeling.

### Briefing
Tensions have been high with the [[Duregar Dominion]] ever since they began expanding outwards from [[Khonudrakar]] far to the east. Now, they have arrived in [[Vietgnome (forest)]] with ill intent on the wind.

The [[Dwarven Mountain States]] are anxious that the [[Duregar Dominion]] intend to take the city, and then use it to capture [[Dwarven Tunnel Intersection]] below, cutting off [[Obar]] and [[Dobar]] from the rest of the states.

The [[Arboral Council]] is currently divided into factions.


### Arrival in [[VietGnome (city)]]
Players enter via airship docking with the [[Banking Branch]]



taken through brief tour of the [[Branch Junction]] and shown around the four other branches as wall as the [[Grand Hall]]



Players will learn via a council meeting the [[Duregarian Dominion]] has advanced beyond the border of the [[Abhainn River]], and have seized control of a region there. Members of the [[Amethyst]] sect will insist that this act is legal, as they have granted the dominion rights to mining operations east of the river, and the specific section they have occupied is still eastern of the western-most part of the stream.

[[Rurik Eversharp]] will ask the party to investigate the dig site, and to discover what the duregar are doing.

Once the council concludes, the players will have until nightfall to gather their gear and depart.
From here the groups are welcome to visit the shops in the [[Roots]], or on the [[Banking Branch]]
