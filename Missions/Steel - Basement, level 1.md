*A neatly decorate marble lobby. The polished floor below reflects the flickering buzzing lights above. Your footsteps echo ominously throughout the space. The east, two large imposing steel doors bar the way. To the west, a series of bright red arrows invite your forward*

The lobby is devoid of life.  From the eastern wall, sounds of slight pangs can be heard.

## 2
*a series of growing marks on the floor usher you forward. Simple music is arcanely playing through the hall. Two figures can be seen walking south towards the lobby. The first is a smiling gnomish women. Her skin is stretched back tightly across her face. Unblinking glass eyes peer at you. Her face is locked in an eternal expression of ghoulish delight. She wears formal Duergarian clothing: A spider silk blouse with an amtheysy vestment over it; Its buttons fastened with bronze glamps. She introduces herself as [[Gertrude]]
The second figure is impossibly thin and tall. Tan leather covers every inch of their body. Even their face is hidden behind some sort of metal mesk with large goggles covering the eyes. Several loose rubber hoses extend from the bottom of the mouth plate, and expand and shrink as a terrible rapsy breathing voice *

[[Gertrude]] will turn into a [[clockwork assassin]] when threatened.

	Two massive metal doors bar the way to the east; An immobile slate of pure steel. On these doors, a symbol is carved into the way. On a DC 14 intelligence check, the party can recall that they saw it above, in one of the components of payload B.
A set of iron rails lead from the doors to the opening of the glass tube in area 2a.

### 2a

### 2b
