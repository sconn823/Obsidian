# Talking to [[Corvos]], [[Buck]] and [[Boudicca]]






# the [[Aerial Bazaar]] 
The [[Aerial Bazaar]] enters town!
## Celebrations in the City
The following modifiers are added:
* Street Performers are on every corner. 
* Loud noises and crowds make perceptions checks in the city more difficult. All perception checks will be made at a disadvantage. 
* As new sources of spirits flow into the city, local bars are trying to stay competitive! All drunk-checks in the city have a + 5 to their Con save DC.
* If any of the performers see the party, they will ask [[Jor]] to head to their ship if he would like to see more!

Some examples of the performers are :
* A troop of Goblin acrobats, tossing each other around in the air, and conforming their bodies into all kinds of uncomfortable positions. 
* Bards playing Clarinets to a pair of beautiful dancing Yuang-Ti
* 


## Description of vessel
* Docked in the banking branch
* A massive, floating purple Narwhal.
	* Weighs over 100 tons
	* Over 500 feet long
	* Its massive, single horn is pure white, and glows faintly, illuminating the creature's ancient and slow face
* Dizzying collections of ropes and pulleys pulled tightly across the Narwhal's form, connecting structures on the sides, top and back. 
* In glowing arcane letters, often changing color and dancing in place, you see the words "Aerial Bazaar" flashing in letters as tall as Gerhardt
* haphazard tethers cling from the deck of several of the wooden structures to the dock
as the group approaches, they can see two figures outside:
* [[Hillbert & Killbert]]. Two Hobgoblin clowns who work for [[Boo Boo The Dumb]]
	* Both wear dimaond mottley patterns. Hillert (on the left) wears orange and blue while Killbert wears red and yellow
	* They introduce themsevles as ambassadors to the Ariel bazzar, the most wonderful show above the sky
	* Where ever they go, they are sure to entertain and bring great glee to those who need it (and are willing to pay!) the most!
	* They introduce the Narwhal as [[Amelie the Anomaly]], finest Astral-Whale in the Realms.
		* With a 15 arcana check, players can idenity Astral-Whales as massive beats, which float across the myoma of the Astral plane between worlds. How this creature got caught here is beyond your understanding
		* With an 18 history check, players can know that whale was first discovered by Dr [[Zagrab Folklore]], a wizard of [[Irises]] and the [[Unknown University]] hundreds of years ago, floating closely behind the moon. He brought the beast down by orchestrating a symphony, and using the natural rocky cliffs of [[Irises]] to amplify his message to the sky above. Some will ask how the music traveled beyodn the void of space. Others might wonder how a person from a medieval world would know that there's no sound in space.
		* With a 16 perception check, players can notice that there is a fin scar across the beast's cheek, almost as if a massive hoot had carved through its flash. Though faded and worn, its quite obvious now that you see it. Humorously, it almost makes the beast appear as if it were smiling. 
	* The hobgoblins invite the players up to visit the Top Hat, above the narhwal's head. The players are invited to navigate the complex mess or ropes and wires leading to the Top Hat.
		* The way is clogged with clustrers of suit cases, small wooden houses with one or more rooms, discarded equipment all tied together in an overcomplicated web of ropes, straps and buckles. Waves of knots and debris , and actual birds nesting in the natural divets of the impressive creature's thick skin.
		* Roll an athetletics or acrobatics to attempt to navigate your way up to the top hat.


## Meeting with Boo Boo in the Top hat
* air is thinner at the top of the beast, so high even above the many walkways 
* The Titanic Topper of a circus tent i stood up via a crown of wires above, pullign the long striped curtains fall neatly between them, forming overlapping covers, fastened horizontally with more facnign ropework to create a tiered appearance downward. You all stand now at the precicipe of the entrance. From within, you can hear a symphony of whismical, upbeat music, and a chorus of hysteric laughter
	* on an insight roll of DC 16, players can tell that the laughter is repeated on a loop. It does not cease. It continues. Again. And again. And again. This hideous laughter echoes all throughout the walls of the Top Hat. 

Gleeful shadows dance between sanguine curtains as you walk deeper, and deeper into the main tent. After what feels like jsut *too* much time walking, you find yourselves in a large shadowy room. The ground beneath is no longer the hardened carapace of the astral narwhal, but a steady flat wooden floor. You hear youyr firssteps echoing almost adding to the percussion of the whismical music, now playing sickenly sweet and fast, and then suddenly, all at once.

The music slows. The laughter disapates

And the clown, the sole occupant of the Atrium of curtains, turns to look at you all, and says

### Interacting with Boo Boo


[[Boo Boo The Klutz]] speaks like a smiling fool, always very excited about what he's talking about, always willing to listen to (but not answer for) any crisitiscms laid out before him. 

He will tell the players he's in town to check on one of his businesses. He's been sent by Powers that Be to investigate why their messages have not been returned.

Booboo knows 

### BooBoo Jokes

	After you're done, there's one less victim to worry about

# Reporting to [[Arboral Council]]

## Meeting with [[Pasiphae]]
The noise of the surrounding area seems to settle for a time. Wind chimes from a small tent on the side of the walkyway call to you. A few branches of sweet smelling leaves are tied into place on the tent's supporting columns by twine wire. The smell of lavender is light and pleasant. 

## Council Buisness
* *[[Gnome Brady]] has been formally replaced on the council by his Elder brother, [[Exile Brady]].
	* He was a remember of the restantice after the [[First Battle of Vietgnome]]
	* One of the conditions of the armistice was his exile, thus his name.
	* However the [[Amethyst]]s were able to push forward a new ruling along with the help of [[Boudicca]] 
	* The rest of the council is quite upset with this ruling, as they felt cheated.
	* [[Ambassador Rubin Obar]] is especially upset, as [[Exile Brady]] killed many dwarves during the Occupation

* [[Viray]] the Pixie is demanding the council open another investigation into the death of King [[Lofiz Berryguard]]
	* Most of the [[Amethyst]]s agree with this, as the death was rather mysterious.
	* Some in the community believe that it was an assassination attempt
	* [[Queen Regent Krixi Berryguard]] will become very emotional at this, and demand that such talks be forestalled, which quiets everyone down.
	* Ask players to roll an insight check:
		1-10: *A sharp, and silent tension fills the room between the three parties. the queen's words have seemed to stop the conversation, but you can feel the unease still permeate the chamber.*
		11-15: *Viray the pixie looks viley angry at the stopping of her motion. Many of the other council members, Exil Brady and Boudica share this smuldering resement. At this moment, you realize that a council member, [[Tobin Rix]] is not present at this time.*
		15-23: *The stares of some of the silvers appears to be less strong. In fact, [[Quincy Endrcot]] you can see is spending an  undue amount of his time polishing his glasses.*
		24+: *[[Ambassador Rubin Obar]] is similarly distracted by a watch he keeps on his person as the tension finally snaps in the room*

* *[[Ambassador Rubin Obar]] is there to meet the players.
	* Expresses the importance of their mission to the players, and thanks them for their service.
	* "Without your help, hundreds of folks living in  the [[Roots]] would have been caught up completely unaware during an attack. The damn Blue-Skins probably wanted to round them up for this 'Communion' process intel has been telling us about."
	* Gives the players the agreed upon amount of 1200 gp
	* Asks the players to look into the [[Aerial Bazaar]], as he is not sure of their loyalty and stance.
