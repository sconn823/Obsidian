## Heading to Bed

Dready and drunkenly, the players make their way up the long winding ramp back to the Lead Balloon and their bunks.  
A swarthing mass of gnomes, drunken from revelry are likewise making their way along the same path.  
Dwarven Rikshaw drivers offer their services up the ramp for 5 gp per rider. They ferry the players using Fowls of Burden - Large bipedal birds native to the forest which were domesticated during the dwarven occupation. 

The birds are ill taken care of, and swarms of flies follow just behind them. This causes them to fly into the player’s faces as they ride their way up. 

As your cart trods its way around the corkscrew ramp, hundreds of lanterns dots all along the branches. For perhaps the first time, you all gain a sense of the thousands of folks who call vietgnome home. All across the canpoy of the great Tree of vietgnome, all creatures are in the night. From the tips of the Wooden palace when [[Prince Orfan Berryguard]] sleeps, to the dusty and dirty refuse of the roots, all are home, and all await the end of the political conflict between dwarven and duergar.

  

## Meeting with Druid [[Boudicca]]

Upon entering the main thorough fair of the tree, your companion [[Corvos]] exits the vehicle, and makes his way over to the grove established at one of vietgnome’s three great branches. He invites Tyto to join him .

  

Crossing through the intersection and onto the branch, you are hit with a wave of light and heat as multiple rows of braziers lines the main road way into the grove. Once, you could tell that this was a thriving ecosystem in its own right; of ancient flora and greenhouses to maintain and celebrate the delicate nature of the vietgnome forest. Now, you are greeted to teh site of whiethered husks and eternal smoke. The leaves and branches supporting this part of the tree appear blackened and gnarled, yet somehow are still able to support the buildings atop it.

  

Few novices can be seen moving in the main roads of the grove. They seem to be mostly maintaining a series of fires and torches that alite the way ahead. From the furrows of their heavy robes you spot the occasional burn mark on their skin. At such constant rates, you surmise that this is a symbol of religious fervor; almost like a baptism of sorts.

  

Finally, Corvos brings you up the base of a mighty ziaggaurt. Multiple bright flames burn atop beacons along the structure, leading up to a flat platform at the top. Here, a singular glass domed terrarium can be found; nursing a small garden of flowers. Before it stands boudica, gently placing her hand upon the glass and tracing its edges; a dc 10 arcana check reveals that she is casting simple mending spells to the structure.

  

She is not happy to see the players. While she nods politely to corvos, and welcomes him back to her grove, she distrusts that the players are working for the dwarves. She shares her timeas a resistance fighter against the dwarven occupation, and questions if there exists any bad blood between the dwarves and herself. She is aware of how they like to keep grudges.  
  

She explains that she does not need a book to remember her grudges, but simply needs to look at her flame burnt skin to remember. She also is thankful for the dwarves; had they not attacked and attempted to burn her hiding place down, she never would have discovered her affinity towards the circle of Fire

  
To Tyto, she asks if he is aware of his matron’s mission on their world, and why she has sent her servants here.  
She explains that the Matron came to her in a dream a blooming flower, and told her to watch for three guardians. She was not expecting a fourth to arrive. They have been in an alliance together in order to contest the destruction of the great tree of vietgnome. She asks if tyto shares that goal, and responds positively if he promises to help her protect it.
