## Heading to Bed

Dready and drunkenly, the players make their way up the long winding ramp back to the Lead Balloon and their bunks.  
A swarthing mass of gnomes, drunken from revelry are likewise making their way along the same path.  
Dwarven Rikshaw drivers offer their services up the ramp for 5 gp per rider. They ferry the players using Fowls of Burden - Large bipedal birds native to the forest which were domesticated during the dwarven occupation. 

The birds are ill taken care of, and swarms of flies follow just behind them. This causes them to fly into the player’s faces as they ride their way up. 

As your cart trods its way around the corkscrew ramp, hundreds of lanterns dots all along the branches. For perhaps the first time, you all gain a sense of the thousands of folks who call vietgnome home. All across the canpoy of the great Tree of vietgnome, all creatures are in the night. From the tips of the Wooden palace when [[Prince Orfan Berryguard]] sleeps, to the dusty and dirty refuse of the roots, all are home, and all await the end of the political conflict between dwarven and duergar.

  

## Meeting with Druid [[Boudicca]]

Upon entering the main thorough fair of the tree, your companion [[Corvos]] exits the vehicle, and makes his way over to the grove established at one of vietgnome’s three great branches. He invites Tyto to join him .

  

Crossing through the intersection and onto the branch, you are hit with a wave of light and heat as multiple rows of braziers lines the main road way into the grove. Once, you could tell that this was a thriving ecosystem in its own right; of ancient flora and greenhouses to maintain and celebrate the delicate nature of the vietgnome forest. Now, you are greeted to teh site of whiethered husks and eternal smoke. The leaves and branches supporting this part of the tree appear blackened and gnarled, yet somehow are still able to support the buildings atop it.

  

Few novices can be seen moving in the main roads of the grove. They seem to be mostly maintaining a series of fires and torches that alite the way ahead. From the furrows of their heavy robes you spot the occasional burn mark on their skin. At such constant rates, you surmise that this is a symbol of religious fervor; almost like a baptism of sorts.

  

Finally, Corvos brings you up the base of a mighty ziaggaurt. Multiple bright flames burn atop beacons along the structure, leading up to a flat platform at the top. Here, a singular glass domed terrarium can be found; nursing a small garden of flowers. Before it stands boudica, gently placing her hand upon the glass and tracing its edges; a dc 10 arcana check reveals that she is casting simple mending spells to the structure.

  

She is not happy to see the players. While she nods politely to corvos, and welcomes him back to her grove, she distrusts that the players are working for the dwarves. She shares her timeas a resistance fighter against the dwarven occupation, and questions if there exists any bad blood between the dwarves and herself. She is aware of how they like to keep grudges.  
  

She explains that she does not need a book to remember her grudges, but simply needs to look at her flame burnt skin to remember. She also is thankful for the dwarves; had they not attacked and attempted to burn her hiding place down, she never would have discovered her affinity towards the circle of Fire

  
To Tyto, she asks if he is aware of his matron’s mission on their world, and why she has sent her servants here.  
She explains that the Matron came to her in a dream a blooming flower, and told her to watch for three guardians. She was not expecting a fourth to arrive. They have been in an alliance together in order to contest the destruction of the great tree of vietgnome. She asks if tyto shares that goal, and responds positively if he promises to help her protect it.

Secretly, beneath the crate of whiskey 


## Gnome Ball
Group is woken up to [[Ambassador Rubin Obar]] waking them up, informing them that the [[Rock Breakers]] Gnome Ball team have suddenly all contracted the plauge and that they desperately need a subsitute team to play

Winner gets the [[Ring of True Companions]]

## Celebration post-game
Players invited by [[Queen Regent Krixi Berryguard]] to feast within the [[Royal Aparmtnet]].

#### Meal
First course is a salad made from glowing plants. When eating them, the players are given a memory of something they are guilty for "Its a delightful little defense mechanism. I like mine with extra-guilt sauce".

second course is a soup of dwarven make.

Its just a bowl of whiskey

Main course will be a honey-roasted Giant Ape Thorax, with skillets of Flying-monkey kebabs (which still slightly levitate)

Desert is that they let loose a hive of bees coated in their own honey.
"We used magic to confuse them so they'd overporduce their own honey, and then slowly roasted the hive"
They cut it open in front of the group

Drinks will include:
	Dwarven Stout
	Gnome Gin-and-panic
	Biosphorian mushroom-wine 
	a scroll of fireball (which can be stolen with a DC 15 sleight-of-hand check)

#### Attendance
Eating amongst them will be other members of the [[Arboral Council]]

[[Tobin Rix]] will be telling a very long and boring story about a time he killed several mercanaries wandering through the [[Collapsed Kingdoms]]. He will also ask [[Gerhardt]] what he would do if the [[Duregar Dominion]] begins expanding into that region.
"You can't expect the Dwarves to help you all the way down there."

[[Valvalur]] will have large Goliath man servants who are delictiely feeding her clippings of herbs and small steaks made from the fat of the roast ape. She will ask the players to show her their feet to verify if they haven't stepped on any smaller creatures. Each character must make a dex check to see how well they've been watching their steps.

[[Boudicca]] will sit next to [[Tyto]] and ask him about himself during the meal. To her, Tyto is unique and represents a kind of freedom she wishes for herself. She will ask him about his travels, and where he sees himself when this is all over.

[[Oakroot]] will sit with [[Thror]] and ask him about his experiences fighting the duergar. In addition, he will ask if there any truth to the rumors he heard that the dwarves may wish to destroy [[Vietgnome (forest)]] if they fear the city is lost.

[[Quincy Endrcot]] will attempt to speak to [[Ramiel]] and [[Kalas]] about a sponsorship deal, but only if they agree to play gnome pop, which sounds like hyper pop music. If they are, they will both instantly get 500 gp but have disadvantage on their performance roles until someone casts a "Remove Curse" spell on them. Allies will also have to roll a DC 10 wisdom save when they are given inspirtation it will fail.

[[Queen Regent Krixi Berryguard]] will sit with [[Jor]] and try to hit on him.
"- I don’t remember casting _Summon Celestial_, but here you are"
"- _Mage Hand_ gives me 5 extra, magic fingers – if you know what I mean"
"- Is that a longsword you’re equipped with, or are you just happy to see me?"

## Conclusion
At the end of the meal, [[Ambassador Rubin Obar]] will ask the players to launch an assault agaisnt the [[Duergar Compound]] on the eastern side of the [[Abhainn River]].
"with the council now divided in our favor, it is the time to strike. Go there, and find out what you can. We assume the fortress may be heavily guarded, but time is of the essence. At this time, we can lend you little support unless the duergar cross the river, so be cautious and don't fight unless you have to."
