## Setup
The Dureragar have been excavating this site ever since [[Empress Nimira]] recieved a message from [[Talos]] stating that something of significance was there. After several weeks of drilling, the Dureragar discovered the remains of the [[B.E.A.C.O.N.]] [[Aquanaut]] beneath the surface of the forest. 

Talos and the emperor conspired to make the suit into an avatar of Talos, by placing captured prisoners into the heart of the marchine, and performing the [[Ritual of Convergence]].

## Gameplay
The goal of this dungeon is for the players to deactivate the malfunctioning servos in the lower left foot to gain access to generator room within the dormant giant, and retrieve the [[Arcane Accumulator]] within.

## Areas

### 1
Entry way from the cavern entrance above.
*Columns of rubble and debris intially block your perception from without the cavern. Venturing further in, the stone here has been cruely chipped away, revealing a horrible metal visage carved from rusted bronze. Its eyes are blotted out and blackened. Rotted ivy clings to its hull, like filthy hair to sweaty flesh. Its gaping maw filled with glass teeth and death. You remember this face. The Marked Men wore it when they earned their title in defeating the Dragon Queen. This is a brother of the Natilus; Submerged under the Ancient forest of Vietgnome.*

Within the mouth of the [[Aquanaut]] are the corpese of several Duergar soliders, and dwarven writing on the eastern wall, above the broken monitor.

#### Engraving
In the dwarvish, the engraving reads:
*"Here lies the crew of the Aquanaut, perhaps the last of their kind from our home Ymir. We were doomed by metal before, and we were doomed by the nature here."*
- [ ] 
Within the opening here is a series of supply crates. They contain mundane supplies and rations. 




### 2
*You begin traversing the metalic throat of the Aquanaut. Each step echoing horribly around the beaten walls about you. The passage gives way to yet another interior composed all of rusted metals. Rows of rotted leather chairs face smashed monitors across the walls. *

*A monitor on the south wall shows a depiction of a large metal contruct with various graphs and displays showing systems in a critical status. Large dwarven glyphs of exclamation can be seen coming from both of the legs of the machine.*

On a DC 11 investigation check, players can determine that these glyphs indicate soemthing in the lower torso is draining all the power to the door controls.


#### Corvos
[[Corvos]] will enter this room as soon as the players enter the cavern. He will hide in a vent, and cast an illusionary version of himself heading to room 4. 

Any players can spot him with a DC 21 Perception check.  

### 3
Pillars room.
*Large metal beams hold the interior of this room together. Each stretches all the way from the bottom of the room to the ten floor ceiling. High piles of rocks and debirs intermingle with the intentionally contrsructed one, obstrucing movement between them*

#### Trap
Two Clockwork Abominations lurk hidden under the rubble. They can be found via a DC 16 perception check.

They will attack any players who attempt to clear the rubble leading to area 10, or when players emerge from room 9.

### 4
*A rusted out room. Metal particles flitter around the room. Green lights glow constantly at the east and west doorways, where red lights are present at the two south rooms.*

Each of the south rooms require a DC 13 
#### 4a
Trap - the whethered remains of a dwarven pilot lays there, a [[Plasma Pistol]] had been used to blow his brains out. 3d4 Cadevar Sprits spring forward from the corpse as the players open the door.

In addition, a note written in dwarvish reads the following:

*The B.E.A.C.O.N. energy reserves are falling. Will need to deactivate all unnecesary output until this is resolved. Might make things easier with one less mouth to feed. I go home now to Moradin*

### 5
*Debris litter the room. Upon close inspection, the damage appears to be recent. Crushed limbs pertrude from the mishapen rock piles.*

5 duergar screamers hide in the area here. They wait until one of the party members triggers the trap in room 6 to engage. They can be seen lurking in the dark with a DC 15 perception check

### 6
*A long rusting hallway. A large door bars the other side and appears be firmly in place.*

In this hallway is a  tight squeeze trap. Any PCs walking through the middle of it must make a DC 18 strength check. On a failed save, they take 5d10 bldugeoding damageas the creature is pulled deeper into the wheels and gears below. If the creature is still grappled at the end of each of their turns per intiative, the gears tug them deeper, dealing another 5d10 damage. 

*You take another step forward and the rusting floor below gives way, gripping your foot between two heavy gears. *

### 8
*This appears to be one of the hands of the mighty titan. A skeletal figure wearing faded blue overalls lies dead. On the form's right arm is a metal gauntlet with spikes sticking out of one side.*

This item is a [[Shield Bracelet]].

9
*An empty, vacant room. The celing to the south and east have all caved in. Horrible amber insects crawl about the space, feasting on metal scraps on the floor and walls.*

### 10
*Empty room. The metal of the hall creeks and wanes under your foot steps. There is a door to the north that looks securely fastened. There is a lever to the left of it.*

The arm is stuck beneath heavy rock within the underground. The stone wall is five feet thick, and completely bars any passage through the arm. Should a player attempt to push through, they will be met with the full force of the weight of the hill atop them.

Pulling the lever requires a DC 17 strength test, and will result in the entire room, and 

### 11
*This room smells of smoke and chemicals. The floor is covered with a greasy brown substance*

Three duergar are sitting in the covering at the far end of the room. When a creature enters room 11, they will throw down torches to set the oil a blaze. The fire will last for 1d4 - 1 turns. Any creature intially caught in the blast will have to make a DC 16 dex saving throw, or take 5d10 fire damage (half on a saving throw)

### 12
*A recently husked corpse lies on the ground, hollow eyes starring into you. There runes on the fallen's jumpsuit reads "Thignil Plateriver". You feel a chill in the air.*
[[Thignil Plateriver]] was the [[Aquanaut]]'s Chief of arcane energy. As the crew attempted to survive in the harshness of their new world, he was determined to reactivate the ship's [[Arcane Beacon]] and escape. 
The ghost of the engineer has little memory and little time to talk to the adventurers as they head out in an attempt ot

- [ ] It appears that the lever wrenched across the cavas above has created some significant damage to the lower body of the 

### 16 
Following the events from last Thror's day game (7/13/23)

In room 2, the group finds an open an open grate, concealed by a piece of sheet metal they had previoulsy passed behind. lingering within the hole is a stray feather. Holding it up to the minimal light in the room reveals iridescent hughes of green, blue and purple. It has an oily sheen about it. 

On a 16 perception check, the players can also find claw marks at the bottom. The edges are blurred within the wet soil underneath the craft, suggesting that a creature had been huddled there for some time. 

The door to room 16 is still closed, but the red light above the door has now been replaced by a steady green one. The hum of mechanisms and engines can be felt under the group's feet. 

*With a click of the keyboard, the doorway to the room slides open. Lying prone on the floor is the form of a large bipedal bird. The creature appears unresponsive, face down on the floor. Dark feathers cover its form, creating a glossy appearance as the light from outside reflects within. Two small feathered-wings pertrude where its arms should be, ending in short talons. The creature's face rests agaisnt the ground at an uncomfortable angle. A long crack traces its way from the edge of its beach all the way up to one of its eyes. 
The creature's clothing appears to be of a simple light-weight cloth, that is covered in damp dirt and what looks like blood.
One of the creature's two legs is twisted at an off angle. 
Further back into the room, you spy a series of metal claws holding in place a blue glowing cube. Another arcane accumulator.*
