During Vietgnome, the Marked Men will visit a city rife with political turmoil. Two large governments, the [[Dwarven Mountain States]] and the [[Duregar Dominion]] are vying for control of the druidic citadel of Vietgnome. The Marked Men will intially enter the city in order to aid the dwarven mountain states before they are flung into a fury of missions due to their own goals and interests.

After five days of adventures, and totally depedent on the player's actions, The Duregar and their extra-planar ally, Talos, shall launch a full scale attack on vietgnome in an attempt to collapse the [[Dwarven Tunnel Intersection]] and take control of the entire region. The Marked will be forced to traverse difficult political espionage, the dangers of the wilds of [[Vietgnome (forest)]], and the technological terrors of [[Talos]], God of Machines

Ultimately the Dureregar are attempting to use an ancient beacon sewn directly into the tree planted there by the late [[King Lofiz Berryguard]] to summon Talos into the world.
