Rock Crackers vs the Leaf Boys

### Rules
#### Actions:
**Pass**: 
Pass the ball from one teammate to another. A pass can travel a maximum distance of 30 feet. To make a pass, make a Dexterity-based attack plus proficiency. A pass is successful if the result of the roll is higher than 10.

Ex: A pass for a level 6 character with a Dex Score of 20:

d20 + Dex Modifier (5) + Proficiency Bonus (3) = 7 + 5 + 3 = 15

**Shoot**: 
Shoot the ball in a certain direction. The maximum distance the ball can travel when shot is 30 feet. To shoot, make a Strength-based attack plus proficiency.

- 10 or lower: The ball travels 10 feet
    
- 11 to 15: The ball travels 15 feet
    
- 16 to 20: The ball travels 20 feet
    
- 21 to 25: The ball travels 25 feet.
    

26 or higher: The ball travels 30 feet

**Tackle**: 
Tackle a creature to take the ball from them and push them 10 feet away. To tackle a creature, make a Strength (Athletics) check. The creature makes a contested Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If your check is higher than theirs, the tackle is successful and the creature lets go of the ball, the ball now occupying the space the creature previously did, and the creature is pushed 10 feet away.



**Steal**: Take the ball away from the grasp of a creature. To steal the ball from a creature, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The creature makes a contested Wisdom (Insight) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If your check is higher than theirs you take the ball away from the creature

#### Bonus Actions:
**Pick Up**: Pick up the ball when the ball is within 5 feet of you. This action can only be executed if the ball is not in possession of a creature.

#### Reactions:
**Intercept**: Stop a pass or shot. If a ball not in possession of a creature enters your range as it is being passed or shot, you can use your reaction to try to intercept the ball. To do so, roll a Dexterity saving throw. If your roll is higher than the roll of the initial pass or shot, you successfully intercept the ball, and it is now in your possession.

**Lunge**: 
Lunge in a direction of your choosing. You can invoke this reaction at any time except during your turn to move up to 10 feet in any direction. You can use this reaction to set yourself up for passes.

#### Taking Damage as ball holder:
**Concentration**: 
If a creature receives any damage while in possession of the ball, they must immediately make a concentration saving throw, as if concentrating on a spell. On a failure, they let go of the ball. The ball now occupies an empty space of the GMâ€™s choice within 5 feet of the creature.
