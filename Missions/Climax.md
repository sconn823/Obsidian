[[VietGnome (city)]] has been overrun by duregar dominion, and limited assistance from dwarven mountain states in site

Players have to fight their way block by block, up the stalk of the tree, and into the royal apartments.

There, [[Empress Nimira]] will be attempting to complete the ritual to allow [[Talos]] to take form in the avatar of the [[VietGnome (city)]], combining the living carcass of the city with the metal and industry below from the [[Dwarven Tunnel Intersection 1]]

The communion ritual interrupted, the emperor channels some of [[Talos]]'s form into a frankenstein creation of [[Oakroot]] with new freakish metal limbs.

## Stage 1
Stage one will involve a difficult fight between the [[Empress Nimira]] and her body guards. The players have a limited number of turns to stop the [[communion]] ritual by releasing the [[Arcane Accumulator]]s located at a central point. Depending on how many they remove, that will determine how succesful the summoning is.

## Stage 2
Depending on how disruptive they were to the ritual, an avatar of [[Talos]] will be created. The players will then be able to use any [[Arcane Accumulator]]s they have taken to power the repaired [[B.E.A.C.O.N.]] [[Aquanaut]], which has been being repaired by [[Rurik Eversharp]] and the spirt of [[Thignil Plateriver]] since [[Day 3]].

The more [[Arcane Accumulator]] that active, the better systems they will have access to for the final battle.
