## Overview

The Steel Obelisk is a [[Duregar Dominion]] constructed east of the [[Abhainn River]] in the forests of [[Vietgnome (forest)]]. 

## History

The tower was initially constructed over a shrine to the [[WildWanderer]], the gnomish god of forests and travel. Following the [[First Battle of Vietgnome]], worship of the WildWanderer was outlawed, and many more wild folk fled to this shrine in order to continue their service to their god. 

The dwarves were more then happy to allow these outliers outside of their territory to worship.
