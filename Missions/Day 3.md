## Evacuating the [[Lead balloon]]
[[Rurik Eversharp]] will explain that he's taking the lead balloon on recon, and the players will have to move all of their belongings to a nearby inn, the [[Spotted Frog]]

## New Mission
[[Ambassador Rubin Obar]] will ask the Marked Men to head east in order to investigate the mysterious [[Steel Obelisk]] that has risen up seemingly over night. 
## Heading through the jungle

Group will leave early in the humid dewey morning. 
It is suggested by Rurik and Ambass Obar that the druegar will see anyone flowing over.
Once the group crosses the river, there will be no assistance from vietgnome or the mountain states. They will be in Dominion terrirroy

They will suggest either stealth, disguise, or speed.
If they start a fight, finish and make sure no one can call for reinforcements

Three survival checks of 10, 14, and 16.
Need to pass 2 / 3 to forgo level of exhaustion

Traveling through this part of the jungle, heading due east, at first is simple as the group is able to use pre-made paths from smaller trading villages near the routes. However, just a few miles away from the furthest point of the eastern most branches of the great tree, the roads become unpave messes of mud and rain. 
The morning sun projects stining heat onto any metal equipment you are carrying, and cloth material clings 


## River Passing

### Scalies
After hours of travel, the group will find themselves heading near a river source when they also meet up with several mercanaries of the [[Scalies]]. The group will mention how they always travel with their masks on, but that's never been a problem to the duergar hosts

### Shallow Bridge
Shallow bridge was construced by the retreating dwarven undermountains after the [[Second Battle of Vietgnome]] as a show of good faith.
Any dwarves proficient with stone cutting can notice dwarven runes indicating instructions for a secret tunnel that would take any who wish underneath the bridge. In this instance, it would put them right behind the below described cannon entrechment.

A bridge spans between the eastern and western banks of the river.
The western portion is devoid of guard. Only banners of a green tree upon a green field signify this as Gnomish-territory.
On the western bank is a squadron of Duergar soldiers.
Each one is equipped with fine armor and weapons. 
Their commander, [[Sergeant Admir ThunderFucker]] is a squat duergar with a thick van dyke beard. Gold piercings are prevelant across his face. Eyebrow rings, nose ridge, septem, lip. Where ever he could have a piecring, he has it and a couple more right next to it. Each time the duergar talks, you can hear the clacking of metal agaisnt one another. Often while he speaks, he will have to suck in spittle stuck to items in his mouth.
