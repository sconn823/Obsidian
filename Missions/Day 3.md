## Evacuating the [[Lead balloon]]
[[Rurik Eversharp]] will explain that he's taking the lead balloon on recon, and the players will have to move all of their belongings to a nearby inn, the [[Spotted Frog]]


## Heading through the jungle

Group will leave early in the humid dewey morning. 
It is suggested by Rurik and Ambass Obar that the druegar will see anyone flowing over.
Once the group crosses the river, there will be no assistance from vietgnome or the mountain states. They will be in Dominion terrirroy

They will suggest either stealth, disguise, or speed.
If they start a fight, finish and make sure no one can call for reinforcements

Three survival checks of 10, 14, and 16.
Need to pass 2 / 3 to forgo level of exhaustion

Traveling through this part of the jungle, heading due east, at first is simple as the group is able to use pre-made paths from smaller trading villages near the routes. However, just a few miles away from the furthest point of the eastern most branches of the great tree, the roads become unpave messes of mud and rain. 
The morning sun projects stining heat onto any metal equipment you are carrying, and cloth material clings 


## River Passing
After hours of travel, the group will find themselves heading near a river source when they also meet up with several mercanaries of the [[Scalies]].
