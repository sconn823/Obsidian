## Traversing through the forest

[[Gerhardt]] and [[Thror]] have opted to traverse through the jungle towards the steel obelisk.

### Intial Forest
Traveling from vietgnome to the [[Abhainn River]] is relavitely simple. The two of them will have to make a DC 10 sruvival check which should be relatively simple. If they fail, they will take 2d6 poison damage as they stumble through a rough patch of poison oak.

### River Passing
Shallow bridge was construced by the retreating dwarven undermountains after the [[Second Battle of Vietgnome]] as a show of good faith.
Any dwarves proficient with stone cutting can notice dwarven runes indicating instructions for a secret tunnel that would take any who wish underneath the bridge. In this instance, it would put them right behind the below described cannon entrechment.

A bridge spans between the eastern and western banks of the river.
The western portion is devoid of guard. Only banners of a green tree upon a green field signify this as Gnomish-territory.
On the western bank is a squadron of Duergar soldiers.
Each one is equipped with fine armor and weapons. 
Their commander, [[Sergeant Admir ThunderFucker]] is a squat duergar with a thick van dyke beard. Gold piercings are prevelant across his face. Eyebrow rings, nose ridge, septem, lip. Where ever he could have a piecring, he has it and a couple more right next to it. Each time the duergar talks, you can hear the clacking of metal agaisnt one another. Often while he speaks, he will have to suck in spittle stuck to items in his mouth.

The group can pass through this easily if they are able to identify the dwarven carvings in it. Else, the group can attempt a DC 15 stealth check to make it through, or a DC 17 intimidation check to move past.

Alternatively, the players can attempt a DC 13 deception check to be treated like mercanaries attempting to join the duergar army. Should they pass this, they will recieve an [[Underbadge]] 

### Compound
*After another hour of walking, you come across a large clearing wheremany trees have been felled. yellow dry grass crunches under your feet. Duergar walk along the permiter escorted by gelantous cubes, asobring any debris they come acorss. In the cneter of the clearing, rising from the earth below you spy a slender black obelisk. Windowless and guarded at its base by a metal wall, this new construction has seemingly sprung up over night according to dwarven intelligence. At the top of the tower rests a massive cannon, pointed west towrads Vietgnome.
 Wagonfulls of prisoners are being escorted downa a narrow asphalt road towards a gate entrance.*

If the players have recieved an [[Underbadge]], they can walk through the area without issue.

If they do not, they will either need to make a DC 17 stealth check to mvoe through the grass. If they attempt to hide in the wagons, the DC will be down to 12. 

Attempting to jump over the walls will require a DC 16 athletics check.
If duergar intercept them 

### Inside the walls
*Small huts and cages house many enslaved gnomes and other woodlen creatures. Styrs, minotaurs and wood gnomes crouch awkwarldy as gun toting duergar patrol around their cages. A merchant can be seeing putting out wares. Several of the duergar with cubes move towards a large perfectly circular hole in the ground and exude the material they left there.


## From Above

*Cold air wafts through the open door. Clouds obscure your view of the field below. *

*Air rushes pass you as you plummet through the clouds. The tower rises above you quickly. The tower and the compound quickly rush to meet you. *

[[Sergeant Giltrude]] went missing in duergar tower.
