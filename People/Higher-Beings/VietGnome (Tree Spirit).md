Less Intelligent Fey creature; vast sleeping unconcious

brought into the world by a soncpsiracy of druids and animals, this tree's spirit was surpressed such that it might follow the will of the druids who inhabitat it.

This means that it will follow their command loyally, but cannot think or make decisions for itself or exert its influence like the tree encountered in the dudmoore swamp.

When the players first meet the tree, they might be able to sense its pain. [[Boudicca]] and her druids are likewise concerned for this, and may ask the players to investigate.
