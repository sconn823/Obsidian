Recently deceased king of [[VietGnome (city)]] and leader of the [[Arboral Council]]. 

The Fappletops have been ruling since Vietgnome was founded several hundred years ago. Lofiz, specifically, had been ruling for the past 10 years since his father, [[King Randy Berryguard II]] stepped down following the [[First Battle of Vietgnome]]. In that time, Lofiz has built strong ties with both the [[Dwarven Mountain States]] and the new rising star, the [[Duregar Dominion]]. In addition, he married his childhood sweetheart and cousin [[Queen Regent Krixi Berryguard]], and had a (supposed) child [[Prince Orfan Berryguard]], named.

However, a few years ago he suspected that [[Prince Orfan Berryguard]] was not truly his heir. In a fit of absolute rage, he secretly struck a deal with the [[Duregar Dominion]] to destroy the [[Dwarven Tunnel Intersection 1]] in revenge for his ruined life. 

The [[Dwarven Mountain States]] intercepted his messages and hired the [[Scarlet Mummors]] to have him assassinated. They do not wish information of this to get out or it would ruin their international image and label them as warmongers, possibly removing them from the [[Emerald Conclave]].
