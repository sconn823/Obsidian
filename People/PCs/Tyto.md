Warlock, bound to the (aptly named) [[Tyto's Matron]]

[[Tyto's Matron]] has taken a keen interest in [[Vietgnome (forest)]]. She seeks to make alliances with [[The Luminous Grove]]. She also wishes to stop [[Talos]] and the [[Duregar Dominion]] from advanving and ruining more of the ancient forest. To this end, she has dispatched several other warlocks into [[Vietgnome (forest)]]. She will request that Tyto find and free these agents, and learn what they have discovered and how they might use that to stop the Duregars.

These Warlocks are similar to Tyto in the sense that they have all been uplifted from humble woodland creatures to intelligent, bipedal humanoids.

Themetically, the goal here is to show tyto that he does not understand all of his matron's workings or plans. The goal is also to make him slightly jealous of his siblings.

Ultimately, the matron does love Tyto, but also has larger plans to arrive into the mortal realm and establish herself as a powerful fixture to protect the natural world.
