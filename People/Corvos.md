Kenku; Uplifted raven. 

Has spent its life flying through the [[Collapsed Kingdoms]], taking in the bounty of nature. Has worked to stop woodsmen from hunting and dispersing the natural nature of the woods.

[[Jan's Character]] and [[Gerhardt]]'s rangers would know him as "The Shade of the Ruins", as a black silehoute can be seen just before attacks.

Corvos's job in the woods was to disrupt the [[Duregar Dominion]] scouts who have moved west of the [[Abhainn River]] and excavating the [[Aquanaut]]

When the group finds him, they will see a position of Duregar firing into the ruins.
